            <h1>WEEK 1</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Amalia Ulman</h2>
                <p>Amalia Ulman is an interesting character, and it makes sense to have her be the first person covered in a class all about identity of the self. Her own identity is skewed, and as reflected in her many Instagram posts, she tries to fit into vastly different identities that don’t really reflect her own. This really helps underline the point Professor Nericcio brought up about multiple identities, and how your own identities are developed based off of the environment. Just like how Amalia was able to create an identity through Instagram, I’ve already created identities vastly different - home with my family, at UCSD with roommates, and in a professional setting with coworkers.</p>

                <h2>Debate</h2>
                <p>The debate was a fun way to both kickstart the quarter and break the ice among my peers in my section. The topic of contention was whether it was moral to genetically modify your children. Although we don’t currently have the technology to modify our genes, with the rise of technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 it is imperative that we at least think about the possibility, in order to be prepared for when the technology comes. Some pros surrounding the topic was of course, the immediate benefit of having much stronger and capable children that can withstand direct harms like diseases. However, some cons surrounded more around the spiritual aspect, as your own identity and self that you poured into your child is removed with every genetic modification. Overall, it was great fun debating the topic and it really made me look forward for what’s to come for the rest of the quarter!</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Ways of Seeing & Berger/McLuhan Mimic essay</h2>
                <p>Reading through Berger’s book on the different ways of seeing the world around us opened my eyes to many different perspectives of the world. One viewpoint I’ve never really considered is the effect of advertisements and how profound an impact they have towards shaping our opinions about the environment, others, and most especially ourselves. Because of this, it was easy for me to pick an advertisement to write about for the Mimic essay, choosing an advertisement on glasses to write in the style of Berger. Writing the essay not only opened my eyes on Berger’s perspective of advertisements, but also let me think more about the impact the advertisement had on my decision to wear contacts for a short while. </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Freud</h2>
                <p>When we started covering Freud I knew that it was going to be a weird and touchy topic. A lot of what Freud did was absolutely weird, but was necessarily weird in order to reshape the modern age of thinking. In class, Professor Nerricio focused on the Oedipus complex Freud had – his more-than-platonic thoughts about his mother – which really emphasized how weird Freud was. From this he developed his model of the human consciousness, focusing a lot on desires and the restraint of desires through social context. Although I disagree a lot with what Freud says about the format of our minds, Freud’s work really opened up the field of psychology, throwing it into a new perspective and paving the way for modern psychology.</p>

                <h2>The Entire History of You</h2>
                <p>Have you ever heard of the phrase “ahead of its time?” In class today we watched an episode from Black Mirror titled “The Entire History of You”.  The episode was centered around a future technology called the “Grain,” which was able to play back memories perfectly. Although Professor Nericcio showcased the episode as a warning of how dangerous technology could be, I disagree and think the episode was really focused more on the flaws of the characters leading to the disastrous and tragic ending. It wasn’t the grain’s fault that the man was a jealous control freak and drunkard, causing a negative atmosphere for the young couple, and it wasn’t the grain’s fault that the woman was an adulteress. Many of the events that occurred would have occurred anyways without the grain, and really the only thing the grain did was uncover the truth for everyone. Although this episode was, in my opinion, not a good example of it, I do agree that we must develop culture alongside technology to progress to the future. </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Frida Kahlo</h2>
                <p>This week was focused around Frida Kahlo, an emerging young artist in the middle of the 20th century with a tragic background.  Frida Kahlo is a good example of a person who was trying to find their identity in the new age of cultural diversity and ethnic melting pot that was the 20th century of America. Through Frida’s work, she expressed her emotional pain and struggle of trying to find and develop her mixed Mexican-American identity, along with the identity she has surrounding her gender, sexuality, and physical trauma. Thinking about Frida reminds me of the work I’ve created and published, which really opened my eyes to how much identity I’ve created and shared through the apps I’ve coded and websites I’ve created.</p>

                <h2>Picturing Autobiography</h2>
                <p>As a direct response to my thoughts on Frida Kahlo’s work and her search for identity in the modern age, I decided to do my autobiography on a time when I felt that what I was creating was helping me shape and figure out my identity. The game I was working on at the time, an online Connect Four clone, had a massive bug that impeded the functionality of the game. The tiles weren’t moving down all the way like they were supposed to! As frustrating trying to fix the bug was, with a bit of creativity and lack of motivation to work any further, not fixing the bug at all made it a completely different game, Connect Fall, which in my opinion is a creative twist on the classic game. This revelation made me reflect on what kind of coder I am, realizing that sometimes the past of least resistance isn’t the worst path you could take. </p>

            <h1>WEEK 5</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Lonelyhearts?  More like Boringhearts.</h2>
                <p>I couldn’t bear to read through Lonelyhearts. I disliked Lonelyhearts too much to make it through the muck of passages and pages of the book. I think this is a case where the identity of the character really clashed with my own identity. I disliked his decision to have relations with his own wife, and how much he rejected religion. Even though I’m not much of a religious person, I disliked the disrespect that emanated from his character.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Google Essays</h2>
                <p>Wow, this was a huge opportunity where I could talk about my identity to someone else. Although the essay was just a job application, the prompt provoked me to really try and explore my professional identity and what I could bring to a workplace, while at the same time what I wanted out of a workplace. While working on the essay, I really kept in mind how wanted to shape my professional identity – how I want the people I work with to think of me. As a result, I think the essays I created for Google were a good reflection of my character, and I hope I get matched to a fitting Google project soon!</p>

            <h1>WEEK 7</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>BAHFest Talks</h2>
                <p>This week, we worked together in groups to create a group presentation on pretty much anything we wanted. Although the BAHFest talks were a little bit off-topic from the theme of searching for identity, I think it was a good opportunity for me to develop skills of both public speaking and working in a group. Surprisingly, collaborating on the creation of the presentation was actually very easy - it was a breeze to put together the powerpoint and work on extrapolating data in order to prove the point that we should drink milk more to live longer. The presentation itself went very smoothly, and I think we made our point quite clear to the audience!</p>

            <h1>WEEK 8</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>HURT BUSINESS - Young Valiant</h2>
                <p>Young Valiant is a play about a boy growing up and raised by his two parents in a lower-class house. Within the play, the parents have a disagreement on how the boy should be raised. The mother wants to raise him as a lover, while the father wants to raise him as a fighter. These opinions of raising the boy stems from their own desires – mother wants a better lover, while father wants to be a better fighter. Although I don’t see it everywhere, I think that this is a case of projecting their own identity onto the child’s identity, and trying to shape the boy into an identity that they want themselves. It’s not as bad as it sounds actually, a lot of people want to shape their children into an identity that they find ideal, varying from a good lover to a strong fighter.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>IGNITE Talks</h2>
                <p>I took the IGNITE talk as another opportunity to try and further my identity, this time talking about my passion of technology. For my topic, I wanted to teach the class the importance of how information gets conveyed through the digital medium, and part a little bit of information on how computers work. Because of this, I chose the idea of explaining how a digital image is stored, since everyone is familiar with images. However, I don’t think I prepared my presentation well enough as the presentation left some people confused. At least this gave me an opportunity to try and share my passion with others!</p>

            <h1>WEEK 9</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Hari Alluri</h2>
                <p>This week, we had guest speaker and poet Hari Alluri talk in the bunker room. I felt that his work focus mainly on his identity as a Latino who had traveled around the world. The topic that resonated the most with me was the idea of losing ancestral identity through the loss of language. In my family, my grandparents collectively speak six different languages – but only two of which I can speak and understand. This really impacts a sense of loss of culture and subsequent sadness at what could have been – I’ve lost something that my ancestors used on a daily basis. As saddening as it is, I definitely think that the loss of language is for the better, as a result of globalization and worldwide cultural melting pot. Because of the increasingly common languages we share with everyone, I am able to communicate with way more people that I ever could have without the loss of languages. And it’s not like I completely lost all culture – I can still speak two of the languages at least!</p>

            <h1>WEEK 10</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Showcase and Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>The showcase was really interesting and it was nice to see how the best IGNITE talks turned out. People were very creative in adding thematic music or even playing their own music, like the ukulele presentation. These talks showed me a deeper meaning of identities that people have picked up from hobbies and interests, and it impresses me greatly just how much passion my fellow classmates have in the identities they’ve formed. I am especially glad that through this class I got the chance to think about and develop my identities, and as a result I feel ready to enter the workforce with my sense of professional identity. It was a fun quarter, and although lectures weren’t the most fun, I definitely had a great time in discussion!</p>
